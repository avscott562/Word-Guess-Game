# Word Guess Game

## Description
This is my version of the classic Hangman game.

## How to Play
The Hangman game can be accessed at [Hangman](https://avscott562.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/).  Opening the game starts a new game board.  The object is to guess the hidden puzzle by selecting letters that you think may be in the puzzle.  You are allotted 12 incorrect guesses.  If you solve the puzzle, you win!  If you do not solve the puzzle before your 12 guesses are up, you lose.  A new game will begin immediately after this game ends.
